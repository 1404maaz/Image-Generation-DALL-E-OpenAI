# Image-Generation-DALL-E-OpenAI

This repository showcases a Text to Image Generation project using the powerful DALL-E OpenAI API. The model transforms textual descriptions into stunning visual representations.

## Overview

The project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to generate images from text prompts using the DALL-E OpenAI API. This process involves sending a description to the API, which then returns a corresponding image.
